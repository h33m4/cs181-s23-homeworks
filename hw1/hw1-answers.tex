{\Large Homework 1: Regression}\\
\end{center}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This homework is on different three different forms of regression: kernelized regression, nearest neighbors regression, 
and linear regression.  We will discuss implementation and examine their tradeoffs by implementing them on the same dataset, 
which consists of temperature over the past 800,000 years taken from ice core samples.

The folder \verb|data| contains the data you will use for this problem. There are two files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|earth_temperature_sampled_train.csv| 
    \item \verb|earth_temperature_sampled_test.csv|
\end{itemize} 

Each has two columns.  The first column is the age of the ice core sample. For our purposes we can 
think of this column as the calendar year BC. The second column is the approximate difference in 
yearly temperature (K) from the mean  over a 5000 year time window starting at the given age. 
The temperatures were retrieved from ice cores in Antarctica (Jouzel 
et al. 2007)\footnote{Retrieved from \url{https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/antarctica/epica_domec/edc3deuttemp2007.txt}

% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Optimizing a Kernel]
Kernel-based regression techniques are similar to nearest-neighbor
regressors: rather than fit a parametric model, they predict values
for new data points by interpolating values from existing points in
the training set.  In this problem, we will consider a kernel-based
regressor of the form:
\begin{equation*}
  f_\tau(x^*) = \cfrac{\sum_{n} K_\tau(x_n,x^*) y_n}{\sum_n K_\tau(x_n, x^*)} 
\end{equation*}
where $\{(x_n,y_n)\}_{n = 1} ^N$ are the training data points, and $K_\tau(x,x')$ is a
kernel function that defines the similarity between two inputs $x$ and
$x'$. A popular choice of kernel is a function that decays as the
distance between the two points increases, such as
\begin{equation*}
  K_\tau(x,x') = \exp\left\{-\frac{(x-x')^2}{\tau}\right\}
\end{equation*}
where $\tau$ represents the square of the lengthscale (a scalar value that 
dictates how quickly the kernel decays).  In this
problem, we will consider optimizing what that (squared) lengthscale
should be.

\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Let's first take a look at the behavior of the fitted model for different values of $\tau$. Plot your model for years in the range $800,000$ BC to $400,000$ BC at $1000$ year intervals for the following three values of $\tau$: $1, 50, 2500$. Since we're working in terms of thousands of years, this means you should plot $(x, f_\tau(x))$ for $x = 400, 401, \dots, 800$. The plotting has been set up for you in the notebook already.


Include your plot in your solution PDF.

\textbf{In no more than 5 sentences}, describe what happens in each of the three cases. How well do the models interpolate? If you were to choose one of these models to use for predicting the temperature at some year in this range, which would you use? 

\item Say we instead wanted to empirically evaluate which value of $\tau$ to choose. One option is to evaluate the mean squared error (MSE) for $f_{\tau}$ on the training set and simply choose the value of $\tau$ that gives the lowest loss. Why is this a bad idea?
    
Hint: consider what value of $\tau$ would be optimal, for $\tau$ ranging in $(0, \infty)$. We can consider $f_\tau(x^*)$ as a weighted average of the training responses, where the weights are proportional to the distance to $x^*$, and the distance is computed via the kernel. What happens to $K_\tau(x, x')$ as $\tau$ becomes very small, when $x = x'$? What about when $x \neq x'$?

\item We will evaluate the models by computing their MSE on the test set. 

Let $\{(x'_m, y'_m)\}_{m = 1} ^M$ denote the test set. Write down the form of the MSE of $f_\tau$ over the test set as a function of the training set and test set. Your answer may include $\{(x'_m, y'_m)\}_{m = 1} ^M$, $\{(x_n, y_n)\}_{n = 1} ^N$, and $K_\tau$, but not $f_\tau$.

\item We now compute the MSE on the provided test set. Write Python code to compute the MSE with respect to the same lengthscales as in Part 1. Which model yields the lowest test set MSE? Is this consistent with what you observed in Part 1?

\item 
Say you would like to send your friend your kernelized regressor, so that they can reproduce the same exact predictions as you. You of course will tell them the value of $\tau$ you selected, but what other information would they need, assuming they don't currently have any of your data or code? If our training set has size $N$, how does this amount of information grow as a function of $N$—that is, what is the space complexity of storing our model?

What is the time complexity of your implementation, when computing your model on a new datapoint? 
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\newpage

{\bf Solution 1: Optimizing a Kernel}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
    Below, we see our model for different values of $\tau$.
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/p1.1.png}
        \caption{Surface}
        \label{fig:q-2-3}
    \end{figure}
    We can see that the model with $\tau = 1$ has a lot of variance, and it over-fits the data, exactly going through all of the points in the training data. The model with $\tau = 2500$ has much less variance, staying within a relatively narrow interval, and with gradual increases and decreases--it looks like it under-fits the data, since it doesn't really reflect the trend in the training data. The model with $\tau = 50$ has a lot of variance, but less than $\tau = 1$, and it seems to capture the trend better than the other models values of $\tau$--this is the model that I would choose.

\item
    As $\tau$ approaches zero: when $x \neq x'$, we have that $K_\tau(x, x')$ approaches zero (since the exponent approaches $-\infty$, and $exp(-\infty) = 0$; when $x = x'$, $K_\tau(x, x')$ approaches $1$. Thus, choosing the optimal value of $\tau$ will result in our model over-fitting our model, since the model would output the true value $y_n$ when $x'$ is $x_n$, and would be undefined for every other $x'$. 

\item
    Our MSE over the test set is as follows:
    \begin{align}
        MSE &= \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \left(y'_m - \textbf{predictions}_m \right)^2\\
        &= \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M\left(y'_m - \frac{\sum_n K_\tau(x_n, x'_m) y_n}{\sum_n K_\tau(x_n, x'_m)} \right)^2
    \end{align}

\item
    Our results are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau$ = 1: loss = 1.9472621565209178
        \item $\tau$ = 50: loss = 1.8582899169613452
        \item $\tau$ = 2500: loss = 8.333886806980793
    \end{itemize}
    We can see that the model with $\tau = 50$ has the lowest MSE, followed closely by $\tau=1$, and $\tau = 2500$ has a much higher MSE. This checks out with our answer in part 1.

\item
    They would need to have the function, and the same training data as me (and assuming they want to make the exact same predictions as me, they'd need the same test data, too.) Storing this information has space complexity of $O(N)$, since a training set of size $N$ stores $N$ pairs $x,y$, and $O(2N) = O(N)$. To compute the model on a new datapoint, you'd have to run it through $f_\tau$, which iterates through every point in the training set, and so has a time complexity of $O(N)$.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}[Kernels and kNN]

Now, let us compare the kernel-based approach to an approach based on
nearest-neighbors.  Recall that kNN uses a predictor of the form
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x^*) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_n y_n \mathbb{I}(x_n \texttt{ is one of k-closest to } x^*)
  \end{equation*}

\noindent where $\mathbb{I}$ is an indicator variable. For this problem, you will use the \textbf{same dataset as in Problem 1}.


%\textbf{For this problem, you may also use the second half of the notebook at {\color{red} update name} \texttt{T1\_P1-2.ipynb}.} 

\textbf{Note that our set of test cases is not comprehensive: just because you pass does not mean your solution is correct! We strongly encourage you to write your own test cases and read more about ours in the comments of the Python script.}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}


\begin{enumerate}

\item Implement kNN for $k=\{1, 3, N-1\}$ where $N$ is the size of the dataset, then plot the results for each $k$. To find the distance between points, use the kernel function from Problem 1 with lengthscale $\tau=2500$. 

You will plot $x^*$ on the year-axis and the prediction $f(x^*)$ on the temperature-axis.  For the test inputs $x^*$, you should use an even grid spacing of $1$ between $x^* = 800$ and $x^* = 400$.  (Like in Problem 1, if a test point lies on top of a training input, use the formula without excluding that training input.) Again, this has been set up for you already.

Please \textbf{write your own
    implementation of kNN} for full credit.  Do not use external
  libraries to find nearest neighbors.
  
\item Describe what you see: what is the behavior of the functions in
  these three plots?  How does it compare to the behavior of the
  functions in the three plots from Problem 1? In particular, which of the plots from Problem 1 look most similar to each in Problem 2? Are there situations
  in which kNN and kernel-based regression interpolate similarly?

\item Choose the kNN model you most prefer among the three. Which model did you choose and why? What is its mean squared error on the test set?

\item As before, say you wanted to send your friend your kNN, so that they can reproduce the same exact predictions as you. You will again tell them the value of the $k$ you selected, but what other information would they need, assuming they do not currently have any of your data or code, and how does this information grow as a function of the size of the training set, $N$? Again worded more formally, what is the space complexity of storing your model?

What is the time complexity of your implementation, when computing your model on a new datapoint? Give a brief overview of your implementation when you justify your answers. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\newpage
 
{\bf Solution 2: Kernels and kNN}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
    Below is the plot of the results for each $k$:
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{hw1/images/p2.1.png}
        \caption{Plot of kNN models}
        \label{fig:p2.1}
    \end{figure}

\item
    We see that for $k=1$, the plot over-fits, going through every single data point and highly fitting the noise. This is most similar to the plot of $\tau=1$. For plot $k=3$, it reflects the trend in the data without over-fitting or under-fitting. This is most similar to the plot of $\tau=50$. For $k=N-1$, the plot underfits the data--it is almost a straight line, and reflects no trend. This is most similar to the plot of $\tau=2500$. It seems that they interpolate similarly when the choice of kernel function for a Kernel-based regression is one that decays as the distance between two points increases, since that more dramatically reduces the effects of points the further away they are from a given $x'$, and highly prioritizing points that are closer, which has a similar effect to only counting the closest points.

\item
    I would choose the kNN model with $k=3$, since the other 2 are clearly not appropriate models (either dramatically over-fitting or under-fitting), and out of the 3 of them, $k=3$ best reflects the trend. Its mean squared error is $3.8907662222222212$.

\item
    They would need to know the distance function, and they would need to have the same training data I used, which means the space complexity of the model is $O(N)$.

    For a given data point, the time complexity is $O(N)$ for calculating the distance between it and every training point (stored in an array), then $O(N\log N)$ for sorting the indices of the array by order of the values in the array (using numpy's argsort() function, which uses a quicksory algorithm) and then $O(k)$ for iterating through the resulting $k$ closest neighbours and finding their average. Thus, the final time complexity for a given data point is $O(N + N\log N + k) = O(N\log N)$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[Modeling Climate Change 800,000 Years Ago]

 The objective of this problem is to learn about different forms of
 linear regression with basis functions.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Recall that in \emph{Ordinary Least Squares} (OLS) regression,
we have data $\{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N = \{\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}\}$ 
where $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$. The goal is to find 
the weights $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ for a model 
$\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w}$ such that the MSE 
\[ \frac{1}{N} \| \mathbf{y} - \hat{\mathbf{y}}\|^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1} ^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\] 
is minimized. 

Without any novel bases, we have merely a single feature $D=1$, 
the year, which is not enough to model our data. Hence, in this 
problem you will improve the expressivity of our regression 
model by implementing different bases functions 
$\mathbf{\phi} = (\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_D)$. In order to avoid numerical instability, 
we must transform the data first. Let
this transformation be $f$, which has been introduced in
the code for you in the notebook.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\phi_j(x)= f(x)^j$ for $j=1,\ldots, 9$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{1.81 \cdot 10^{2}}.$
  \item $\phi_j(x) = \exp\left\{-\cfrac{(f(x)-\mu_j)^2}{5}\right\}$ for $\mu_j=\frac{j + 7}{8}$ with $j=1,\ldots, 9$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{4.00 \cdot 10^{2}}.$
  \item $\phi_j(x) =  \cos(f(x) / j)$ for $j=1, \ldots, 9$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{1.81}$.
  \item $\phi_j(x) = \cos(f(x) / j)$ for $j=1, \ldots, 49$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{1.81 \cdot 10^{-1}}$. \footnote{For the trigonometric bases (c) and (d), the periodic nature of
cosine requires us to transform the data such that the 
lengthscale is within the periods of each element of our basis.}

\end{enumerate}

{\footnotesize * Note: Please make sure to add a bias term for
all your basis functions above in your implementation of the 
\verb|make_basis|.}

Let 
$$ \mathbf{\phi}(\mathbf{X}) = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\mathbf{\phi}(x_1) \\
\mathbf{\phi}(x_2) \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{\phi}(x_N) \\
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}.$$
You will complete the \verb|make_basis| function which must return
$\phi(\mathbf{X})$ for each part 
(a) - (d). You do NOT need to submit this
code in your \LaTeX writeup.


For each basis create a plot of your code graphing the OLS 
regression line trained on your training data against a 
scatter plot of the training data. Boilerplate plotting code
is provided in the notebook. \textbf{All you need to include 
in your writeup for 4.1 are these four plots.}

\end{problem}

\newpage
\begin{framed}
\noindent\textbf{Problem 3} (cont.)\\
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item 

We now have four different models to evaluate. Our models had no
prior knowledge of any of the testing data, thus evaluating on
the test set allows us to make stronger (but not definitive!) 
claims on the generalizability of our model.

Observe that there is never an objectively ``good'' value of MSE or negative log likelihood - we can use them to compare models, but without context, they don't tell us whether or not our model performs well.

For each basis function, complete three tasks and include the
results in your writeup: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the MSE on the train and test set. 

\item Assume that the data is distributed as 
$y_i = \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x}_i + \varepsilon$ where 
$\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$, we roll in the bias 
$\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ x_i \end{bmatrix}$, and each data point
is drawn independently. Find $\sigma_{\text{MLE}}$ and $\mathbf{w}_{\text{MLE}}$ (recall the formulas from class!) and use these to 
compute the negative log-likelihood of a model with parameters $\sigma_{\text{MLE}}, \mathbf{w}_{\text{MLE}}$ on your train and test sets. 
The following derives the likelihood.
\begin{align*} p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{X},\mathbf{w},\sigma_{\text{MLE}}) 
&= \prod_{i=1}^N \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{y}_i \mid \mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x_i}, \sigma_{\text{MLE}}^2) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma_{\text{MLE}}\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{(y_i - \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x}_i)^2}{2\sigma_{\text{MLE}}^2}\right)
\end{align*}

\item Make a claim regarding whether this basis overfits, 
underfits, or fits well. Write 1-2 sentences explaining your 
claim using the train and test negative log-likelihood and MSE.

\end{itemize}
\item For the third time, you wish to send your friend your model. Lets say you fitted some weight vector of dimension $D$. What information would you need to share with your friend for them to perform the same predictions as you? Do you need to share your entire training set with them this time? Again, what is the space complexity of storing your model?

Given an arbitrary datapoint, what is the time complexity of computing the predicted value for this data point?

How do these complexities compare to those of the kNN and kernelized regressor?

\textbf{Your response should be no longer than 5 sentences.}

\end{enumerate}
Note:
Recall that we are using a 
different set of inputs $\mathbf{X}$ for each basis (a)-(d). 
Although it may seem as though this prevents us from being able 
to directly compare the MSE since we are using different data, 
each transformation can be considered as being a part of our model. 
Contrast this with transformations (such as standardization) that cause the variance
of the target $\mathbf{y}$ to be different; in these cases the
MSE can no longer be directly compared.

\end{framed}

\textbf{Solution 3: Modeling Climate Change 800,000 Years Ago}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
    Below are the 4 plots:
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.47]{hw1/images/p3.1.png}
        \caption{OLS regression plots for 4 different $\phi(\textbf{X})$}
        \label{fig:my_label}
    \end{figure}

\item
    The results are copied from the code and pasted below:\\

    \begin{enumerate}[a]
    \item 
    Train MSE: 4.83; Test MSE: 7.96
    
    Train Negative Log-Likelihood: 125.768; Test Negative Log-Likelihood: 63.256

    This fits the data well, as it follows a general trend without following the noise. The test and train MSE values are close in value, as are the train and test NLL values.
    
    \item
    Train MSE: 5.53; Test MSE: 8.71
    
    Train Negative Log-Likelihood: 129.620; Test Negative Log-Likelihood: 64.035
    
    This fits the data well, as it follows a general trend without following the noise. The test and train MSE values are close in value, as are the train and test NLL values.
    
    \item
    Train MSE: 2.88; Test MSE: 5.97
    
    Train Negative Log-Likelihood: 111.018; Test Negative Log-Likelihood: 62.098

    This fits the data well, as it follows a general trend without following the noise. The test and train MSE values are close in value, as are the train and test NLL values.
    
    \item
    Train MSE: 0.64; Test MSE: 58.90
    
    Train Negative Log-Likelihood: 68.303; Test Negative Log-Likelihood: 1162.188

    This overfits the data, as we can see that it goes through practically every data point in the plot. The test and train MSE values are also very different in value, as are the train and test NLL values, with both MSE and NLL dramatically higher for the test data than the train data.
    \end{enumerate}

\item
    This time round, we don't need to share the entire training set with them, since it's only needed to calculate the weights (which we've already fitted.) However, the weights were calculated using transformed data with a specific base, so that would have to be shared. This would have a space complexity of $O(N \cdot D)$, since the basis would be an array of size $N \times D$.

    Calculating the predicted value for an arbitrary datapoint, given the weights and the basis, involves a dot product between the basis array, of size $N \times D$, and $\textbf{w}^T$ of size $D$, and so this has a time complexity of $O(N)$.

\textbf{Prompt:} You are leading the machine learning team that is advising the US president. The US president is concerned about 3 things - climate change, the energy crisis in Europe and sustainable energy security in the US and asks you to help him understand what the driving factors of annual US energy consumption might be.  


How would you build a regression model that can be used to explain the driving factors of the annual US energy consumption? Please answer the questions below by using concise language (350 - 700 words). Bullet points are appropriate. 


This question is a conceptual question, and you are not required to implement the actual model. Yet, it is important that you think through your approach and its implications. 


\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Target variable:} What target variable would you choose and what would be its unit? 
\item \textbf{Features:}  List 5 possible features and explain your assumption why you think they might impact the target variable. 
\item \textbf{Dataset size:} What should be the size of your dataset / covered time period? Why? 
\item \textbf{Performance metric:} What metric would you use to assess the model’s performance? 
\item \textbf{Policy decision:} Explain one policy decision the US president could make based on your model. 
\item \textbf{Trust:} What could be barriers for the US president to trust your model?  List two possible barriers. 
\item \textbf{Risk:} What happens if your model is wrong/inaccurate?  List one real-world consequence. 


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution 4: Impact question}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
    I would choose annual US energy consumption as the target variable, since that's what we are trying to explore. This is measured in KiloWatt Hours.

\item
    Considering the things that the US president is concerned about, 5 possible features we could use are: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
        US population. My assumption here is that there is a positive correlation between the population size and energy consumption.

        \item
        Energy prices. This refers to how much individuals pay for electricity annually, and my assumption is that the more people have to pay, the more energy is being consumed.

        \item
        Global levels of CO2. This is a big indicator of climate change, and although it is usually a feature that is affected by consumption of energy, it may also have an effect on the consumption of energy.

        \item
        Electric vehicles owned. Climate change is commonly attributed to the usage of petrol/diesel powered vehicles. This is one of the aspects that the president was concerned about, and my assumption is that electric vehicles require less energy consumption. 

        \item
        Number of companies that adopted eco-friendly practices. My assumption is that eco-friendly practices reduce the consumption of electricity, and so there is a relationship between how much energy is used and how many companies are adopting these practices. 
        
    \end{itemize}

\item
    I would use data from 1990 to present, as the Third Industrial Revolution kicks off. This is I wouldn't want to include data that was before the main sources of energy consumption became consistent. In addition, I think data from 1990 is more likely to be reliable, with less noise. All in all, it's not dataset that's too large, but big enough to show a trend, if there is one.

\item
    MSE

\item
    The president could potentially decide on implementing policies that led to improving incentives for companies to implement eco-friendly practices.

\item
    He could be concerned that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        the data might not accurately reflect the effect of the features on the target variable–for example, the impact of a given company adopting eco-friendly on US energy consumption probably varies depending on how big the company is
        
        \item 
        the model's features are limited (with not enough focus on the international relationships and current affairs.)
    \end{itemize}

\item
    It could lead to misinformed policy decisions that lead to unintended consequences–for example, missing features such as investments in renewable energy could lead to the US not keeping up with the rest of the world in global energy usage.
\end{enumerate}
